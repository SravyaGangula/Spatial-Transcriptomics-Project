# Spatial-Transcriptomics-Project

# Objective:
To analyze spatial transcriptomics data to identify patterns of gene expression across tissue regions, integrate simulated immunofluorescence data, and visualize biological insights. This analysis demonstrates the ability to preprocess, analyze, and interpret spatial transcriptomics data in a research or clinical context.

# Goal:
	1.	Perform quality control (QC) on spatial transcriptomics data.
	2.	Cluster tissue regions based on gene expression profiles.
	3.	Integrate simulated immunofluorescence data to demonstrate data integration.
	4.	Visualize spatial relationships using interactive plots.

# Introduction:
Spatial transcriptomics combines spatial imaging with RNA sequencing to study gene expression while preserving tissue morphology. This project analyzes spatial transcriptomics data to uncover biological patterns, integrates fluorescence data, and visualizes spatial gene activity using Python.

# Pipeline Overview:

# Step 1: Load and Explore Data
# What We Are Doing
	•	Load the spatial transcriptomics dataset.
	•	Review the structure and basic statistics of the data.
# Why It’s Important
	•	Understanding the dataset structure ensures proper handling of data throughout the pipeline.
	•	It identifies potential data issues (e.g., missing values).
# Expected Result
	•	A tabular view of the data showing spatial coordinates (X_Coordinate, Y_Coordinate) and gene expression levels (Gene_A, Gene_B, etc.).
 
 # Step 2: Perform Advanced Quality Control (QC):
 # What We Are Doing
	•	Log-transform gene expression data to stabilize variance.
	•	Standardize spatial coordinates to prepare for clustering and visualization.
	•	Check distributions of gene expression values.

 # Why It’s Important
	•	QC removes noise, stabilizes data for clustering, and ensures biological relevance.

 # Expected Result
	•	Cleaner data with log-normalized gene expression values and standardized spatial coordinates.
	•	Distribution plots for each gene to assess data quality.
 
 # Step 3: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
 # What We Are Doing
	•	Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of gene expression data.
	•	Apply KMeans clustering to group spots based on gene expression profiles.

 # Why It’s Important
	•	Dimensionality reduction simplifies complex data for visualization.
	•	Clustering identifies biologically distinct tissue regions.

# Expected Result
	•	A PCA plot showing clusters of tissue regions.
	•	Cluster labels assigned to each spatial spot.
 
 # Step 4: Simulate and Correlate Immunofluorescence Data

 # What We Are Doing
	•	Generate synthetic fluorescence signals for integration.
	•	Analyze correlations between fluorescence signals and gene expression levels.

 # Why It’s Important
	•	Demonstrates the ability to combine spatial data with additional modalities (e.g., fluorescence).
	•	Correlation analysis identifies genes associated with fluorescence signals.

 # Expected Result
	•	A heatmap showing correlations between fluorescence signals and gene expression.
 
 # Step 5: Visualize Spatial Data

# What We Are Doing
	•	Create interactive scatter plots to display spatial relationships.

# Why It’s Important
	•	Interactive visualizations are critical for communicating findings to stakeholders.

# Expected Result
	•	A spatial scatter plot showing clusters and fluorescence signals.

# Step 6: Biological Interpretation

# What We Are Doing
	•	Summarize key findings, such as cluster-specific gene expression.

# Why It’s Important
	•	Biological interpretation adds value by linking analysis to real-world applications.

# Expected Result
	•	A summary table highlighting genes associated with each cluster
 
# Conclusion
	•	Pipeline Summary: Preprocessed, analyzed, and visualized spatial transcriptomics data.
	•	Key Findings:
	•	Clusters revealed distinct tissue regions based on gene expression.
	•	Significant correlations between fluorescence signals and gene expression patterns.
	•	Impact: Demonstrates ability to handle bioinformatics data, integrate modalities, and deliver actionable insights
